## 🔧 Important Fix - Guest User Access (October 20, 2025)

### Problem Identified

**Error:** `Uncaught TypeError: can't access property "profile_picture_url", user is null`

**Root Cause:** 
Public gallery pages (`/galleries` dan `/galleries/{id}`) were using `AppLayout` which requires an authenticated user. When guest users (not logged in) accessed these pages, the `UserInfo` component tried to access `user.profile_picture_url` but `user` was `null`.

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Removed AppLayout from Public Gallery Pages ✅

Public gallery pages now use **standalone layout** like the articles pages, instead of `AppLayout` which requires authentication.

**Files Changed:**

- **`resources/js/pages/gallery/index.tsx`**
  - ❌ Removed: `import AppLayout from '@/layouts/app-layout'`
  - ❌ Removed: `import { type BreadcrumbItem } from '@/types'`
  - ❌ Removed: `<AppLayout breadcrumbs={breadcrumbs}>` wrapper
  - ✅ Added: Standalone layout with custom header and container

- **`resources/js/pages/gallery/show.tsx`**
  - ❌ Removed: `import AppLayout from '@/layouts/app-layout'`
  - ❌ Removed: `import { type BreadcrumbItem } from '@/types'`
  - ❌ Removed: `<AppLayout breadcrumbs={breadcrumbs}>` wrapper
  - ✅ Added: Standalone layout with custom header and container

#### 2. Layout Structure Change

**Before (❌ Error for guest users):**
```tsx
<AppLayout breadcrumbs={breadcrumbs}>
    <Head title="..." />
    <div>Content</div>
</AppLayout>
```

**After (✅ Works for everyone):**
```tsx
<>
    <Head title="..." />
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-background">
        <div className="border-b bg-card">
            <div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-12">
                {/* Custom Header */}
            </div>
        </div>
        <div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-8">
            {/* Content */}
        </div>
    </div>
</>
```

#### 3. Follows Articles Pattern

Public gallery pages now follow the same pattern as `resources/js/pages/articles/index.tsx`:

| Feature | Articles | Galleries (Public) |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Layout | Standalone | Standalone ✅ |
| Auth Required | No | No ✅ |
| Header Style | Custom border-b | Custom border-b ✅ |
| Container | mx-auto px-4 | mx-auto px-4 ✅ |
| Guest Access | Yes | Yes ✅ |

### Backend Improvements (already completed)

**`app/Services/GalleryService.php`**
```php
// Ensures only galleries with valid users are displayed
->whereHas('user')
->with(['user:id,name,angkatan,profile_picture'])
```

**`app/Models/Gallery.php`**
```php
// Auto-append image_url to JSON response
protected $appends = ['image_url'];
```

### Benefits of This Implementation

1. ✅ **No Authentication Required** - Guest users can view galleries without logging in
2. ✅ **Consistent UX** - Follows the same pattern as articles page
3. ✅ **Type Safe** - TypeScript ensures null checks are performed
4. ✅ **Better Performance** - Doesn't load auth components unnecessarily
5. ✅ **Clean Separation** - Public pages separated from authenticated pages

### Testing Checklist

- [x] ✅ Guest user can access `/galleries` without error
- [x] ✅ Guest user can access `/galleries/{id}` without error
- [x] ✅ Images display correctly
- [x] ✅ User info displays (or fallback "Alumni")
- [x] ✅ Pagination works
- [x] ✅ Search & filter work
- [x] ✅ Share button works
- [x] ✅ Production build successful
- [x] ✅ TypeScript type checking passed

### Key Takeaway

**Public routes should NOT use AppLayout.** Use standalone layouts like articles for public-facing content. AppLayout is reserved for authenticated user dashboards (alumni/admin).
